Following Assumptions has been made:
  1. json-files: Assumptiion has been made that json-files/users will have users.json file and json-files/tickets will have tickets.json only
  2. Since multiple files can be places in json-files/users/ folder, it has been assumed that all the users and all tickets will have different ids
  3. Since I was not making any API calls, I didn't mock functions, instead allowed them to be called in testing.
  4. while entering data for verified for user search, make sure, it is either true or false
  5. Name searches are done for whole name, so for name "Gagan" , "Gag" wont work
